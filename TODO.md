# TODO — lume (host)

The host repo mirrors `lume-core`'s `lang/` tree via `make sync-lang`;
interpreter/language fixes belong in lume-core and flow here (host-owned
files — currently `typecheck_expr.c`, `typecheck.c`, and the interp.c
minijson include block — must be hand-merged). Server-side fixes belong
to the standalone `agent-httpd` repo (mirrored here as the
`agent-httpd` submodule).

## P9 (mirror) — for-in over an inline temp value: heap corruption under agent-httpd

`for (x in get(load_xxx(), "k", []))` — iterating an inline expression
chain not bound to a `let` — crashes the HTTP server after ~5 repeated
requests (silent SIGSEGV, no panic output; stdout is block-buffered and
lost). Empirically established on this repo's binary serving the
chinese knowledge project (`work/knowledge/chinese`, fix `c10f23d`);
full investigation, evidence, and the ASan triage plan live in
**lume-core `TODO.md` → P9** (the bare-interpreter path does NOT
reproduce, so the bug sits at the interpreter/agent-httpd lifecycle
boundary).

Host-side items:

- [ ] After the core P9 fix lands, hand-merge any interpreter-side
      change into host-owned files (if applicable), re-run
      `make sync-lang` discipline (commit content first, then sync to
      refresh the PIN), and re-verify the chinese project's original
      inline-temp handler under ASan + the 14-endpoint smoke.
- [x] Containment in dependent code: all 9 inline-temp for-in loops in
      `chinese/server.lume` converted to `let`-before-loop (2026-10-20,
      chinese `c10f23d`); recite ×11 + full smoke green.
- [x] Coding rule for host/lang code and lume programs served by
      agent-httpd: **never iterate an inline expression chain in
      for-in** — bind the iterable to a `let` first. Recorded in the
      chinese project memory and here until P9 is fixed.
