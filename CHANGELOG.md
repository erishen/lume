# Changelog

All notable changes to Lume are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and versions aim for
[SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- `--help` / `-h` CLI flag: prints usage and exits 0 (previously fell into
  the unknown-flag error path and exited 2).
- One-command installer `install.sh`
  (`curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erishen/lume/main/install.sh | sh`)
  — downloads the platform binary from GitHub Releases to `~/.local/bin/lume`;
  `LUME_VERSION` / `LUME_PREFIX` / `LUME_SHA256` overrides.
- Prebuilt binaries for all four platforms (linux-x64/arm64, darwin-x64/arm64)
  as `lume-<os>-<arch>`, built by a GitHub Actions matrix and attached to the
  release on tag push; the same matrix runs on push/PR to catch cross-platform
  build failures before a tag is cut.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-24

Initial release — a self-contained agent DSL server (one C11 binary serving
static sites, JSON APIs, SSE chat, agent tools and SSR pages).

### Added

- Lume DSL: lexer/parser/type-checker/tree-walking interpreter with `el()`
  and `html()` page builders, agent-httpd bridge (HTTP, chat SSE, MCP, tools).
- Product API (`iquest`): weekly report archive + approval settings endpoint
  with whitelisted keys, same-origin CSRF guard, atomic .env write-back.
- Native SQLite: `sql_query` (read-only, physically enforced via
  `SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY`), opt-in guarded `sql_write`, `sql_tables`,
  `sql_schema` — no Python, no MCP stdio process.
- Text2SQL: live schema + data discipline injected into the chat system
  prompt (DataPulse-style describe), cached by db mtime.
- `lock_file(path, wait_ms?)` / `unlock_file()` built-ins: flock-based
  advisory lock (auto-released on process death), serializing invest ledger
  read-modify-write across workers.
- `write_file` is atomic: payload goes to a sibling `.tmp.<pid>` file renamed
  over the target; created files are `fchmod`'d 0600.
- invest weekly reports get a `YYYYMMDD_HHMM` timestamp — same-day
  regenerations no longer overwrite each other.
- Kubernetes manifests (`docker/k8s/`): invest / hub deployments with Basic
  Auth from a Kubernetes Secret.
- Six examples: demo / hello / invest / hub / lang-basics / sqlite-write.
- Tooling: `make dev|invest|hub|demo-sqlite|test|check|clean`, `make asan`
  (ASan/UBSan), `make vsix` (VS Code extension pack), `make ui` (esbuild /
  Tailwind frontend bundles).
- CI: GitHub Actions (test + asan) with agent-httpd vendored as a git
  submodule pinned by gitlink.
- Docker: two-stage image rebuilding the C binary inside a Linux container;
  compose stack for invest / hub behind Basic Auth.

### Changed

- `examples/invest.lume` and the frontend report/date handling accept the new
  timestamped report names.
- invest default tool whitelist is read-only; `sql_write` is opt-in via the
  whitelist (`HARNESS_TOOLS_ALLOW`).

### Security

- Same-origin guard covers **GET and POST** product endpoints
  (`/api/reports`, `/api/reports/*`, `/api/settings`): cross-origin browser
  reads are rejected 403 (DNS-rebinding style theft), `Origin: null`
  rejected, origin-less curl / local scripts still work.
- invest server binds `127.0.0.1` by default (loopback only); dead
  `write_file` entry removed from the invest tool allow-list; cross-border
  data disclosure banner + privacy policy added to the settings page.
- Settings endpoint redacts `env_file` and upstream URLs (`configured`/`null`),
  provider control characters rejected (400), write-back refused when
  `IQUEST_ENV_FILE` is unset.
- Portfolio ledger write path: per-process flock + atomic rename; load
  failure prints an explicit corruption warning instead of silently
  continuing with an empty ledger.
- Private data permissions: `.data` 0700 via `mkdir`, mcp config written with
  `fchmod 0600`, session files 0600, access logs never record query strings.
- Frontend has zero third-party calls; `read_file` jailed to web root; MCP
  children get LLM keys unset; sessions TTL 30 days.
